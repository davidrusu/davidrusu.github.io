This was one of two oolongs that came in Octobers batch of the Yunnan Sourcing dark tea club. It was a great first batch for me from this tea club, I'm really happy with the teas I got but it's a little expensive so I'll probably stop after next months batch

This tea had some really nice leafs, long, matte black with a musky aroma. The tea itself is very mellow with no bitterness what so ever, it has a slightly rocky taste and leaves a bit of a tacky texture in the mouth. I can get about 5 brews out this tea before it's lost it's character.

*I love oolongs!*
